# Provably Random Raffle Contracts 

## About

This code is to create a provably random smart contract lottery. 

## What do we want it to do? 

1. Users can enter by paying for a ticket
    1. The ticket fees will go to the winner during the draw. 
2. After X period of time the lottery will automatically draw a winner. 
    1. And this will be done programmatically.
3. Will be using Chainlink VRF and Chainlink Automation 
    1. Chainlink VRF --> Generating provably random number
    2. Chainlink Automation --> Time based trigger
